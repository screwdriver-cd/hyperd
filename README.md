HyperContainer - Hypervisor-agnostic Docker Runtime
====

> This repo contains two parts: the daemon of HyperContainer `hyperd` and the CLI`hyperctl`.

## What is HyperContainer?

**HyperContainer is a hypervisor-agnostic technology that allows you to run Docker images on plain hypervisor**.

## Why HyperContainer?
-----------

**HyperContainer combines the best from both worlds: VM and Container**.

| -  | Container | VM | HyperContainer | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Isolation | Weak, shared kernel | Strong, HW-enforced  | Strong, HW-enforced  |
| Portable  | Yes, but kernel dependent sometimes | No, hypervisor dependent | Yes, hypervisor agnostic and portable image |
| Boot  | Fast, sub-second  | Slow, tens of seconds  | Fast, sub-second  |
| Performance  | Great | OK| Good, minimal resource footprint and overhead |
| Immutable | Yes  | No, configuration management required | Yes, only kernel+image  | 
| Image Size| Small, MBs  | Big, GBs  | Small, MBs  |
| Compatibility | No, need new tools | Great, everything just works  | Good, it is still a "Machine", much less changes  |
| Mature   | Not yet  | Production ready, SDN, SDS, LiveMigration, etc.  | Yes, just plug-&-play|
| ROI| Rebuild everything with container  | - | Reuse your virtual infrastructure  |

> **BYOK* = bring your own kernel

## Requirements

- QEMU 2.0 or later (QEMU 2.6 or later for ARM64 Architecture)
- Xen 4.5 and VT enabled host (for Xen support)

## Installation

Ensure you are running Linux (kernel 3.8 or later) and have QEMU (version 2.0 or later) installed. 
Then download the [binaries](http://download.hypercontainer.io/) and install them (hyper-container and hyperstart) directly.

For the detail of installation, please refer to [the documents](https://docs.hypercontainer.io/get_started/install/linux.html).

For information on using the command line, just type `hyperctl`. You may use
`hyperctl <command> --help` for detailed information on any specific command.


## Build From Source

Clone hyperd in GoPath

    > mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hyperhq
    > cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hyperhq
    > git clone https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperd.git hyperd

And make sure you have `go` (>= 1.7) , `device-mapper-devel`, and `autotools`, go into the `hyperd` dir

    > ./autogen.sh
    > ./configure
    > make

Then you can find the binaries `hyperd` daemon and `hyperctl` cmdline tool in current directory. Before running those commands, a config file needs to be placed at `/etc/hyper/config` directory, and you can find a sample under `${TOP}/package/dist/etc/hyper/config`. `Kernel` and `Initrd` are required for starting the hyperd daemon, you can find those files from [HyperStart](https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperstart) project.
